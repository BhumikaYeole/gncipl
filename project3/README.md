# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers of a retail store based on spending habits and demographics. Using the **Mall Customers dataset** from Kaggle, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments that can guide marketing and sales strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer demographic and spending data.
- Apply the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Use **K-Means clustering** to segment customers.
- Visualize the clusters for actionable business insights.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Load dataset, handle missing values, select relevant features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize feature distributions and relationships.
3. **Elbow Method** – Determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. **K-Means Clustering** – Apply the algorithm to segment customers.
5. **Visualization** – Plot clusters using scatter plots for better interpretation.

## 📈 Results
- Optimal number of clusters: **5**
- Customers segmented into:
  1. Low income – low spending
  2. Low income – high spending
  3. Medium income – medium spending
  4. High income – low spending
  5. High income – high spending
- Businesses can now target promotions and services more effectively.
